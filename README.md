# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction

In this project, we built a model to predict whether health insurance policyholders from past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance provided by the company.


The following machine learning models were used: 
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree 
* Random Forest 
* LightGBM

| Logistic Regression   | 0.862       | 0.792     |
| Decision Tree         | 0.737       | 0.821     |
| Random Forest         | 0.737       | 0.823     |
